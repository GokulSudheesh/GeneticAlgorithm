### Crossover Operations
In one point crossover, a random crossover point is selected, and the halves of the two parents are swapped to generate new off-springs.

In uniform crossover, each bit is chosen from either parent with equal probability. Just like flipping a coin to decide whether a bit will be included in the offspring.<br>

### Mutation Operations
In bit flip mutation one or more bits are selected, and their values are mutated i.e. we change 1s to 0s and vice versa.<br>
