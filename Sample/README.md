Just a simple problem to demonstrate GA.
#### Fitness
The fitness will be calculated based on how close a candidate solution is to the target binary sequence: “111111….”. For example, an individual with the sequence, “11111111” will have a fitness 0 and an individual with a sequence of “00000000” will have a fitness value of 8. Here, we are looking for the optimal solution by checking least value of fitness.
